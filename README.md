Aggregreater (like "feed aggregrator", but "greater") is a full-stack web application inspired by NewsBlur.  It is served by a Ruby on Rails API backend with PostgreSQL database and a React.js/Flux frontend.

## Features & Implementation

### Single-Page App

### Feed Sources

### Folders

### Feed Filtering

### Saved Articles

## Features to add

### Supplementing RSS-Provided Content

Use curl to grab more content from feed source websites where possible including more article content, pictures and icons to represent the feeds.

### UI Improvements

The content changes quite a bit as new feed items are loaded and it would be better to make these changes more obvious to the user when they are happening

### Drag-and-Drop Reordering

Users may have many feeds and keeping them organized would be more convenient if it were possible to drag and drop feed sources inside and between folders
